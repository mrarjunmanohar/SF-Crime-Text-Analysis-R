# San Francisco Crime - Text Analytics Basics

This is a text analytics project to understand the recent spikes in crime in the San Francisco Area by analysing Twitter data.

While this analysis is in no way absolute, it was my first attempt at text mining/text analytics through R Programming. The code is exclusively written on R and is reasonably commented for ease of reference. In case of any queries, feel free to email me at arjenmanohar@live.com or connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunmanohar/

For a more a detailed account on my observations and analysis kindly refer to the PDF report within the repository. 

The following project was conducted as part of my Text Analysis Course at Hult International Business whilst studying my masters in Business Analytics
